# Choice of language

# Status: accepted

# Context:

In order to develop and implement a user manager for this application, I 
will be using PHP. 

# Decision:

Due to how the ease of implementation and how widespread the use of PHP is,
I chose it as my chosen language for this application. In addition, I have 
some experience in PHP and know that it has effective and convenient features 
that will help with working with Apache and MySQL. The queries and functions 
can be created with PHP effortlessly in order to manage the database as needed.

# Consequences:

There is not much of a learning curve required for using this language or 
implementation.
